## Project Description
The **Blockchain-based Loyalty Program** is a decentralized rewards management system built on the Stellar blockchain. The program allows businesses to issue loyalty points to customers, who can redeem these points for rewards. Transactions, including reward issuance, redemption, and tracking, are managed through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and efficiency. All transactions are carried out using Lumens (XLM), providing secure, fast, and low-cost operations.

## Project Vision
The vision of the **Blockchain-based Loyalty Program** is to create a decentralized, transparent, and efficient platform for managing customer rewards. By leveraging blockchain technology, businesses can offer a seamless loyalty experience while customers can trust that their points are securely tracked and easily redeemable. This approach removes intermediaries, reduces operational costs, and ensures a tamper-proof rewards system that benefits both businesses and customers.

## Key Features
